# Image Reizer
Simple html page that will resize an image.

Simply host this html file on a public web server. You can then pass three parameters to the url: width, height, and imageurl. For example, I've hosted this on AWS S3 (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/WebsiteHosting.html) in the example below
